                The global economy is experiencing a period of uncertainty as inflation continues to rise in major economies. 
                Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany are witnessing significant price increases across various sectors,
                 from energy to food supplies. Central banks are working to adjust interest rates to combat inflation, 
                 but the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions have made stabilization challenging. 
                 Many fear that prolonged inflation could lead to slower economic growth and increased living costs for millions around the world.

                In 2024, the impacts of climate change have become more evident as record-breaking heatwaves and natural disasters sweep across continents. 
                Europe and North America have experienced their hottest summers on record, leading to widespread wildfires and droughts. 
                In Asia and the Pacific, devastating floods and typhoons have displaced thousands. 
                The United Nations has renewed calls for urgent global cooperation to mitigate climate change, pushing for immediate reductions 
                in carbon emissions and greater investment in renewable energy sources to prevent future environmental disasters.

                The pace of technological innovation is accelerating, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and renewable energy sectors. 
                AI continues to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation with advancements in machine learning, automation, and data analytics.
                 Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydrogen are gaining momentum as global leaders seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. 
                 Governments and private companies are investing heavily in clean energy solutions to meet climate goals and reduce dependence on traditional energy sources, 
                 positioning technology at the forefront of future development. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)

                Eastern Europe has seen a surge in political unrest, with conflicts in several regions raising international concerns. 
                Ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to destabilize the region, while smaller nations are grappling with political turmoil and economic instability. 
                The situation has prompted NATO and the European Union to increase their involvement, offering diplomatic and, in some cases, military support to affected countries. 
                The international community watches closely as these developments could have widespread geopolitical ramifications.

                2024 has been a landmark year for space exploration, with several countries and private companies pushing the boundaries of human achievement. 
                NASA’s Artemis program has made significant strides in its mission to return humans to the Moon, with plans for a manned lunar landing by 2025.
                 Meanwhile, SpaceX and other private firms continue developing technology for Mars exploration, aiming to establish the first human colonies on the Red Planet in the coming decades. 
                 These efforts highlight humanity’s growing ambition to explore and possibly settle beyond Earth.

                Despite the challenges posed by political tensions and the pandemic, major sporting events have continued to capture global attention. 
                The 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris were a highlight of the year, with athletes from around the world competing in a wide range of sports. 
                However, the event was not without controversy, as political protests and concerns over athlete safety due to new COVID-19 variants overshadowed some of the celebrations.
                 Other major sports leagues, such as international soccer tournaments and the NBA, have also faced similar issues, balancing the excitement of competition with the challenges of a rapidly changing world.

                <p>Of The World Inflation</p>

                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 1970</h4>
                        <p>
                            The world experienced high inflation due to the oil crises of 1973 and 1979. 
                            Rising oil prices led to increased costs for goods and services, causing inflation rates to skyrocket, particularly in the United States and Europe.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 1980</h4>
                        <p>In response to the high inflation of the previous decade, central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve in the US, raised interest rates sharply. 
                            This helped to control inflation but led to a global recession in the early 1980s.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 1990</h4>
                        <p>
                            Inflation rates stabilized in most developed countries as central banks adopted inflation-targeting policies. 
                            The global economy saw lower inflation during this period, with technological advancements contributing to price stability.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Inflation remained relatively low in most developed nations, but emerging markets experienced higher inflation due to rapid economic growth and increased demand for resources.
                             The 2008 global financial crisis temporarily lowered inflation as demand for goods and services dropped.

                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2020</h4>
                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains, leading to shortages and price increases. 
                            Governments around the world implemented large stimulus packages, which began to spark concerns about inflation.</p>

                        <p>
                            Inflation surged worldwide due to post-pandemic recovery, supply chain issues, and rising energy prices. Central banks, 
                            including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, began raising interest rates to combat inflation,
                             creating concerns about potential recessions.

                        Despite massive monetary stimulus programs, inflation stayed low in most advanced economies.
                        The Eurozone experienced near-zero inflation, and Japan continued to battle deflation, 
                        while emerging markets still faced moderate inflationary pressures.
